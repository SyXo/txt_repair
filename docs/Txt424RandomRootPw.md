With this tool you can fix the problem, that the Update Routine in ROBOPro does not work and shows the
message:
"Error Update phase 2 (or 3)"


Double-click on the file New_Random_Root_Pw.bat which is located in the folder TxtRootPwTools
The following window appears:
Enter "y" and "Return". The window will be closed then.

Restart your TXT Controller

Restart ROBOPro and try again to update the TXT Controller again. If the error message still appears it is
necessary to send the TXT to the fischertechnik service in order to be repaired.
